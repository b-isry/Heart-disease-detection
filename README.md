<h1>Heart Disease Prediction Model</h1>
<p>This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient health metrics. The model is built using Logistic Regression and trained on the heart_disease_dataset.csv dataset.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Input: Patient health metrics such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.</li>
  <li>Output: Probability or prediction of heart disease (binary classification: 0 for no disease, 1 for disease).</li>
  <li>Model: Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Accuracy: 0.8</li>
</ul>
